Pandas is a Python library primarily used for data analysis and manipulation. It offers data structures like Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrames (two-dimensional) that are built upon NumPy arrays, providing efficient ways to handle and analyze structured data. This functionality makes Pandas a powerful tool for tasks ranging from data cleaning and transformation to statistical analysis and visualization.
Key Features:

**Data Structures:** Series and DataFrames are fundamental, enabling the representation of various data types in a structured manner.

**Data Manipulation:** Pandas facilitates operations like merging, joining, reshaping, and pivoting datasets.

**Data Cleaning:** It provides tools for handling missing data (e.g., NaN values) and removing irrelevant entries.

**Data Analysis:** Functions for calculating statistics, grouping data, and applying custom operations are available.

**Integration:** Pandas integrates well with other Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, enhancing its capabilities for scientific computing and visualization.

**Input/Output:** It supports reading and writing data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more.
